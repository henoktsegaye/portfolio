Welcome to the **Understanding Javascript basics** series. On this blog we will try to understand primitive types in Javascript. 

let's get to it üôÇ

---


Javascript has primitive types (primitive values) that are directly represented at the lowest level of the language implementation.
Javascript in general has two types of data types - **primitive** and **non-primitive** (Object).
Anything other than primitive types in JavaScript is an object. Functions, classes, arrays and **user defined types** are all objects.
You can tell this by using the **typeof** operator which might not be accurate at a time but it's a good enough approximation.

```
typeof 'hello' // string
typeof true // boolean
typeof 1 // number
typeof {} // object
typeof null // object
typeof undefined // undefined
typeof function () {} // function
typeof Symbol('hello') // symbol
```

But here `typeof null` is an object which is not actually true since null is a primitive type.

```
typeof null // object
```

This is considered a bug in javascript.
Javascript primitive types are not objects and their values are immutable. but variables can be reassigned to a new value.
Doing so will create a new variable and the garbage collector will clean up the old one.

example of primitive type immutability
```
let a = 1;
let b = a;
// changing a will not change b
a = 2;
console.log(a); // 2
console.log(b); // 1
```
As both `a` and `b` are primitive types, they are not related to each other.
when copying `b` from `a` Javascript **will copy the value of `a` and assign it to `b`** , so changing one will not change the other.


Let's dive deep into this
<CodeAndImageBox url={"/assets/blog/JP1.jpg"} code={`
let a = 1;
`}
/>


Initializing a variable with a primitive type will create a new value in **stack** and assign the variable to it. JavaScript creates primitive types in stack with fixed space while **Objects** are created in **heap** memory, This is because objects are mutable and can be changed at any time taking up more memory.
This is true because you can mutate objects adding new properties or changing existing ones.


<CodeAndImageBox url={"/assets/blog/JP2.jpg"} code={`
let a = 1;
let b = a;
`}
/>


Copying a primitive type will create a new value in **stack** and assign the variable to it.At this point both `a` and `b` are pointing to different values in the stack.


<CodeAndImageBox url={"/assets/blog/JP3.jpg"} code={`
let a = 1;
let b = a;
a = 2;
`}
/>


Changing the value of `a` will not change the value of `b` since they are pointing to different address in the stack.At this point **GC( Garbage Collector)** will remove unreferenced addresses from the stack.

Comparing primitive types to object üëáüèæ
```
let a = {
    value: 1
};
let b = a;
// changing a will change b as they have the same reference
a.value = 2;
console.log(a.value); // 2
console.log(b.value); // 2
``` 
As you can see in the above example, Objects variables don't hold values but references, so changing `a` will change `b ` as they have the same reference.

Well if primitives are not Objects you might ask how are we accessing properties off them like this example below ?
```
'hello'.length // 5
```

This is not a **bug in javascript üòÑ.**


This is actually one of the features of javascript. Primitives are not Objects but they **act like they are** ü§î ? Well here is how it works

Javascript maps out primitive types to **_Wrapper Objects_** which is the reason we can see the `length` property of a string.
Which will actually create a new object with value `"hello"`, so you can access the length property ( or any-other String property ) off that object. This is actually true for Other two Primitive types **Boolean** and **Number** .

```
let strObj = new String('hello')
typeof strObj // object
strObj.length // 5

// access the value of the object , which is the primitive value
strObj.valueOf() // hello
typeof strObj.valueOf() // string
```

Boolean Object
```
let boolObj = new Boolean(true)
typeof boolObj // object
boolObj.valueOf() // true
typeof boolObj.valueOf() // boolean
```
Number Object
```
let numObj = new Number(1)
typeof numObj // object
numObj.toFixed(2) // 1.00

numObj.valueOf() // 1
typeof numObj.valueOf() // number
```

But once we had access to the property of the object, garbage Collector will remove unused objects from memory.

Javascript has 7 primitive types:

- undefined
- null
- boolean
- number
- string
- symbol - es2015
- bigint - es2020


The `symbol` data type is new in es6.
`bigint` is new in es2020.

JavaScript is different in the way it treats **Numbers** and **Strings** ( they are represented as a primitive type on their own) which 
is not as common in stablished programming languages like Java, Which for example represent numbers differently according to their size and properties.
Float numbers have a **float** type in **Java** and integers as **int** while in javascript they are both just represent as **Number**.


We will dive deeper into those primitive types and javascript implementation difference with other programming languages in the next blog of this series.

Big thanks for the people whom helped me review the wording in this blog.
