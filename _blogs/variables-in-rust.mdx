title: Variables in Rust.
description: Aha Rust the most loved programming language. What does its variable look like if it does have one? Spoiler alert it does have one and it is very interesting.

Hello 👋🏾 , welcome !

I am learning Rust and I am finding much of the language very interesting and I am falling in love already , haha.

Either ways I wanted to blog some the topics that I am learning and Find interesting and I am staring with the basic!

## Variables

Few points about variables in Rust.

1. Every variable is immutable by default
2. to make it mutable you can just add `mut`
3. Variables are ==! constants
4. Constants are always immutable , you can make variables mutable or not
5. Constants should be annotated! 
    
    ```rust
    // varaibles with default immutablity
    let a = 4;
    
    // mutable vairables
    let mut a = 4
    
    // convention to make your constant Capital and snake case 🐍
    const EXAMPLE_CONSTANT:u32 = 444;
    ```
    

## Constants ☀️

Constants can be declared on any scope 

- Global scope
- any other scope

In **`Rust`** Scopes are determined by **`{}`** unlike `JS`  which depends on the declaration keyword you use 🤦🏾‍♂️.

If you use `var` its function scoped while `let` and `const` act on a `{}` scope!

 Constants could only be set to a constant expression that include a variable with a known value before runtime

```rust
const FIRST_CONSTAT:u32 = 33*33; ✅
// So you can't use mutable variable to compute value of a constant!
const SECOND_CONSTAT:u33 = a*4; ✅

let mut ex = 3;

// this is going to throw an error compile time!
const THIRD_CONSTANT = ex*4 ❌
```

I.e rust uses snake-case with capital for constants as a convention!

## Shadowing 🥷🏾

Shadowing happens when you hide a variable in a higher scope or same scope by using the same variable name.

Shadowing is common in many programming languages and somehow the same rule applies to `rust` but rust shadowing was weird for one reason. 

- You can shadow a variable in the same scope 🤯
    
    If you tell this to `JS` It would probably crash! 
    

```rust
// declare a variable with name a
let a = 33;

// Error ( variables are immutable )
a = 32;
// this is valid in rust ( same scope level shadowing)
let a =32;

fn deeper() {
	// now a is different
	let a = 44;
}
```

The above code will throw an error for immutability  ! but re-declaring with the same is fine with `rust` 🦀

# Data types in Rust

Rust have two types of data `scaler` and `compound`

Scalar Data types are four

1. Character
2. Integer
3. Float
4. Boolean

Here  notice string is not a scalar data type!

### Characters

Characters are four byte size data types that can hold unicodes , and characters in different languages.

### Integers

Integers can be signed or unsigned and can hold different sizes of data. the well known sizes are the following

1. 8 ( u8 , i8)
2. 16 (u16 , i16 )
3. 32 (u32, i32 )
4. 64 (u64 , i64 )
5. 128 ( u128 , i128 )
6. arch (usize , isize) - this depends on the arch of your computer - if your computer is 64 bit it will be 64 bit , if not 32 bits or what ever the arch of your computer is!

so for signed Integers

1 bit is used for sign so the actual value the number variable can hold is 2^(n-1) for any n while 

for unsigned it would just be `(2^n)-1`

## Number literals

Number literals are exciting way of writing different base of numbers in that languages - the first  four are basically same as JS except for using `_` (which is basically the same as `,` in Real life 🙂)

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Number literals</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Decimal</td>
            <td>98_222 same as 98,222</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hex</td>
            <td>0xff</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Octal</td>
            <td>0o77</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Binary</td>
            <td>0b1111_0000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Byte (u8 only)</td>
            <td>b'A'</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

</table>
 

### Integral overflow

I suggest you don’t overflow your `int` but if you do be aware of how rust handles it in Prod. 👇🏾

[link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow)

### Float Numbers

represented as single or double permission , implemented the same as JS , IEE-754 standard.

Sounds familiar ? JS has the same standard too!

```rust
// single percision
let a: f32 = 44.4;
// double percision ( default )
let b: f64 = 44.33;

```

*Integer Operations*  truncate toward zero ( for +,-,*,/)

## compound types

There are two primitive compound types 

1. Tuples ( array of different types )
2. Array ( type of similar types ) - Array have fixed size and data is allocated on the stack rather than the heap.

```rust
// tuple with two i32 bits
let tup = (33,33);

// type for tuples
let person: (str,u8) = ('abebe', 22)

let arr1 = [33,44]

// which is the same as below (with data annotation)
let arr1:[i32;2] = [33,44]

```

One main difference between those two compound types and other collections you encounter in `rust` like `vec` and `String` is that these compound types live in the stack because
